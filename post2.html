        <h1>A Conversation that Changed My Perspective</h1>
        <p class="date">Posted on: October 16, 2024</p>

        <p>Last week, I attended the Grace Hopper Celebration (GHC) in Philadelphia, and with 30,000 participants, I wasn’t surprised to meet some on my way home.</p>

    <p>After boarding my flight, I sat down, frantically trying to download lecture slides for my upcoming make-up tests. Lizzie, the woman next to me, noticed my stress and suggested I charge my phone with my iPad, though I didn’t have the right cord. We quickly realized we both attended GHC and struck up a conversation.</p>

    <p>Over the next hour and a half, we discussed everything from tech to hiking adventures. Lizzie had recently moved to Houston from Seattle, and as a fellow hiking enthusiast, we bonded over our shared love for the outdoors—especially Glacier National Park, our favorite. Beyond hiking stories, what stood out to me about Lizzie was how she seamlessly blended her career as an Integrated Risk Engineer with broader interests, integrating not just technology, but business, education, psychology, and law. Her work involves analyzing data security risks, balancing the costs of mitigating versus accepting those risks, and presenting these analyses to clients. I was struck by how her role extended beyond the technical—into understanding human behavior, teaching cybersecurity to MBA students, and considering legal frameworks in her risk assessments. It was inspiring to see how her diverse interests fueled her professional growth.</p>

    <p>Meanwhile, Lizzie’s sister, who works remotely from Alaska while redesigning Costco’s website for EY, showed me how it's possible to blend a passion for outdoor adventures with a demanding tech career. I had always assumed that once you started working full-time, personal interests would take a back seat. But hearing her story made me rethink that assumption. The idea that careers in tech can offer such flexibility was refreshing, and I realized that my own passions and career aspirations didn’t have to exist in isolation.</p>

    <p>Our conversation also sparked thoughts about my own path. Consulting had intrigued me due to my brother’s and sister-in-law’s work at BCG. Hearing Lizzie discuss her sister's role in technology-based consulting gave me new insights into how my interest in tech and business might intersect.</p>

    <p>What surprised me most was how aligned her work in risk analysis was with my studies in cognitive science and computer science. Lizzie shared how understanding behavioral psychology was crucial in her job. Company leaders might believe certain risks need mitigation, but data analysis can show it’s better to accept them. The gap between subjective judgment and optimal decision-making fascinated me. Her mention of teaching cybersecurity to MBA students also resonated. I’d always considered teaching but wasn’t sure if academia was the right fit. Hearing how she combined business and education shifted my perspective on what teaching could look like outside of traditional academia.</p>

    <p>We exchanged LinkedIn contacts after landing, and I offered to give her a tour of Rice University, where she’ll visit next week.</p>

    <p>On my way to the plane, I also connected with someone in line at Jamba Juice. We bonded over outdoor adventures after I noticed her Mt. Whitney keychain. Although she hadn’t hiked it, her skiing trip to Mammoth led to a lively conversation, and she invited me to meet up in Seattle if I’m ever in town.</p>

    <p>These encounters reaffirmed how shared interests outside of career-driven mindsets can build meaningful connections and inspire new perspectives on balancing life and career. I’m also inspired by how all these seemingly distinct fields—tech, business, psychology, and law—are interconnected, showing that a person doesn’t have to focus on just one area in their lifetime. Instead, we can explore and engage with multiple disciplines, finding ways to weave them together in meaningful ways.</p>
